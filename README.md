==========

Simple AHK script that boosts my productivity in windows.

Inspired by KBC Pocker and XMonad

### Arrow Movement

The most important guys are

```
LAlt + W|S|A|D : Arrow keys
LAlt + [|'     : Home|End
```

__Ctrl__ and __Shift__ can be used in conjunction with ``LAlt + W|S|A|D`` for
move by words and text selection

### Window Management

* Switch back and forth between frequently used apps

    ```
    Ctrl + Alt + B : Chrome
    Ctrl + Alt + N : Gvim
    Ctrl + Alt + T : Terminator
    Ctrl + Alt + E : Explorer
    Ctrl + Alt + J : Last active app
    ```

* Cycle through windows using ``Ctrl + Alt + H|L``

* Hide current active window using ``Ctrl + Alt + U``

    (particularly useful to hide an auto-hide Taskbar when you don't want it to
    appear when mouse hovers on it)

  Use ``Ctrl + Alt + R`` to pop a window from the hide stack and show it

### Other goodies

```
LAlt + / : Del
LAlt + Q : Esc
LAlt + F : Global Search (available in win8)
Ctrl + Alt + Shift + F : Toggle FullScreen (buggy)
```
