==========

Simple AHK script that can boost your productivity in windows.

Inspired by KBC Pocker and XMonad

Cursor Movement
===========

The most important guys are

```
LAlt + W|S|A|D : Cursors
LAlt + [|'     : Home|End
```

Ctrl and Shift can be used in conjunction with ``LAlt + WSAD`` for move by words/text selection

Window Management
=================

Switch back and forth between frequently used apps

```
Ctrl + Alt + B : Chrome
Ctrl + Alt + N : Gvim
Ctrl + Alt + T : Terminator
Ctrl + Alt + E : Explorer
Ctrl + Alt + J : Last active app
```

Cycle through windows using ``Ctrl + Alt + H|L``

Hide current active window using ``Ctrl + Alt + U`` (particularly useful to
hide an auto-hide Taskbar when you don't want it to appear when mouse hovers on
it)

Use ``Ctrl + Alt + R`` to pop a window from the hide stack and show it

MISC
=======

```
LAlt + / : Del
LAlt + Q : Esc
LAlt + Q : Esc
LAlt + F : Global Search (available in win8)
Ctrl + Alt + Shift + F : Toggle FullScreen (buggy)
